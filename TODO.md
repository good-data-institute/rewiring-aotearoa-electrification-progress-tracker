- Update ingestion APIs with all valid parameters and options + split logically by e.g. by data source, dashboard page
- Add S3 read/write functionality
- Run ETL pipelines, store processed and metrics data for the last 5-10 years
- Update dashboard APIs to read and query for metrics (if not available, run ETL)
- Develop frontend
- Create infra and move env variables into render.yaml (also needs to work for local though)
- Add cataloguing/lineage (maybe move ETL to dbt/sqlmesh)
