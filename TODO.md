- Update ingestion APIs with all valid parameters and options + split logically by e.g. by data source, dashboard page
- Update dashboard APIs to read metrics
- Add S3 read/write
- Create infra and move env variables into render.yaml (also needs to work for local though)
- Add cataloguing/lineage (maybe move ETL to dbt/sqlmesh)
